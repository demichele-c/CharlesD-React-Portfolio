## Installation

This portfolio project showcases my journey as a Full Stack Developer, combining the skills I acquired during the UCF Full Stack Coding Bootcamp with my diverse background in restaurants, commercial diving, and technology. The project is built using React, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript, offering employers and collaborators an interactive experience to explore my work. It features light and dark mode, responsive design, and various projects I've developed, each highlighting specific technical challenges and solutions. The portfolio provides a streamlined way for potential employers to learn about my skills, view my projects, and get in touch.

## Usage

To use this portfolio, simply navigate through the sections using the navigation bar. You can view my projects by clicking on "Projects," read about my background in "About Me," or download my resume from the "Resume" section. Each project card provides a brief description, and you can click "See It In Action" to view live demos or explore the code on GitHub. Light and dark mode toggling is available for user preference.
